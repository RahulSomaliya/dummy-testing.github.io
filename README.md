# guess-my-number

This is a learning beginner JS project that I made to pick up DOM manipulation. 

Dear player, its a simple game where you just pick a number between 1 and 20 - I will hint you whether you're close or not from either direction. See if you belong to 5% lucky players scoring 20 on first guess! 

Here's the deployed game - https://rahulsomaliya.github.io/guess-my-number/
